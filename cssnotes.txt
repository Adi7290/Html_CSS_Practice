value values associated with these properties

always remain same wherther we apply internal or external styling

different ways to write css 
inline css
internal css
external css

priority order in css is inline internal external


inline css 

before css this was the only way to apply styles

not an efficient ay to write as it has a lot of redundancy

self contained

uniquely applied on each element

idea of separation of converns was lost

example

<h3 style = " color :red"> have a great day </h3>

<p style = "color:green"> i did this i did that </p>

#internal css
with the help of style tag we can applye styles withing the html file

redundancy is removed

but idea of seperation of concerns still lost
uniquely applied on single document

example

<style> 
	h1{
	color:red;
	}
</style>
<h3> have a great day</h3>


#External css

with the help of <link> tag in the head we can apply styles

reference is added

file saved with .css extension

redundancy is removed

idea of separation of concerns is maintained

uniquely applied on each document

example
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="">

h1 {
	color:red //.css file
}
